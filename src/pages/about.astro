            Sarah Blake grew up in New Jersey, but countless family dinners in
            Philadelphia made Philly feel like home, too. She got her BA in
            Mathematics from The College of New Jersey, then her MA in English
            from The University of Texas at Austin, followed by her MFA in
            Creative Writing from The Pennsylvania State University. Then she
            moved back near Philadelphia, this time on the PA side of the city,
            where she lived for eight years.

          <p class="mb-5">
            In 2019, she moved to the UK,
            published her first novel, and then her mother died and her marriage
            of nearly ten years fell apart. She has been piecing her life back
            together with the help of her family, friends, and readers. She
            writes about these strange years in her Substack, The Vulgar
            American.

            short stories are at Short Édition, Catapult, and Berfrois. Her
            interview series are at The Chicago Review of Books and at The
            Rumpus. Her recent poems are at Court Green and NightBlock.

            Blake has always been interested in collaborative and
            interdisciplinary work. For nearly a decade she has collaborated
            with visual artist and poet, Nicky Arscott, whose work is in both
            Let’s Not Live on Earth and In Springtime. One Way to Get There is a
            poem in parts, self-published, illustrated by Peter Santa-Maria,
            coded by Noah Schoenholtz using Reveal.js by Hakim El Hattab.
            Blake’s chapbook, Named After Death, was published alongside a
            workbook for adults, filled with activities and writing prompts.

            The entirety of The Starship was first published in daily, illustrated
            installments at Berfrois, with each day featuring a different
            artist. And a recording of the beginning of The Starship, originally
            recorded for TriQuarterly, was in the song, “We’re Getting Older,”
            by Instar.

            One poem from Mr. West was selected by director Ayse
            Altinok to be made into a short film for Motionpoems. The film of “A
            Day at the Mall Reminds Me of America” can be watched here.

            To
            celebrate the release of her second novel, Clean Air, Blake worked
            with computer programmer, Maxi Schell, to design a small video game,
            which can be played here.
